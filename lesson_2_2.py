# A student has taken 3 tests in a class, and wants to know their current grade 
# (which is only calculated by these tests). 

# Ask the user to input all three of the test scores for the student, one by one. 

# The program should then calculate the average test score (average is adding all three 
# test scores together then dividing by 3), and then print the student's letter grade 
# (as well as the average score as a number).

# Gregory wants to know how many toys they can buy at Toys'N'Us

# They prioritize buying the most expensive toys first (For ejm. If Gregory had $50 
# they'd end up buying 2 Jumbo Baby Yoda Plushies, 1 Beyblade, and 5 Sticky Hands with 
# a remainder of $0.30 left)

# Have the user input how much money Gregory has then print how many of each 
# toy they can afford, as well as how much money they'd have remaining
